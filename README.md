# Geomash

This is a geographic parsing library. It is designed to take subject and other text strings and return hierarchical data
along with coordinates for that string.

Beyond regular parsing to mapquest api, bing api, and google api, it currently also supports TGN and Geonames.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'geomash'

The following options can all be configured. If any of these are skipped, those resources won't be
available.

    tgn_enabled: <true or false>

    geonames API account: http://www.geonames.org/login

    Mapquest API key: http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/open
    (NOTE: Recommended to skip this API key. I can't get reliable / good results. I've left in support just in case
    someone wants to still use it or can improve this).

    Bing API key: http://www.bingmapsportal.com
    (NOTE: Only semi-reliable as a geographic source. Recommended to skip this as well).

You will need to use the "geomash.yml.sample" file in the `config` folder as "geomash.yml" in whatever
application you plan to use this gem in. If you have directly checked out this repository, you will need to rename
"geomash.yml.sample" in that `config` folder to that "geomash.yml" and fill in the values you have. Then using
"rake" in the root of the checkout out directly will run unit tests.

## Usage

For the full parsing of a known geographic string (for example, "421 S Salisbury St, Raleigh, NC 27601" or
"Paris, France"), do that following:

    Geomash.parse('<string>')

For parsing of a LCSH subject (or similar) with geographic data located in the USA currently (such as
"Chicopee (Mass.) -- City Directories", "Women--Employment--Massachusetts--Holyoke", or "Palmer (Mass) - history"),
then pass in a second parameter of true to indicate an attempt to parse the string. NOTE: As the BPL is a USA based
organization, this is currently limited to USA locations. I'd be happy to work with an international entity to expand
this parsing. :)

    Geomash.parse('<string>', true)

Once that is complete, any coordinates returned will be near-exact location coordinates, otherwise that is left blank.
In addition, you may have received a tgn_id or a geonames_id (if those are configured and a match was found) along with
if those entries can completely replace the geographic data of the original string (for example,
"421 S Salisbury St, Raleigh, NC 27601" has a street address part that those hierarchies cannot duplicate).
To get the hierarchy, official coordinates, and other information, use the functions below:

    Geomash::Geonames.get_geonames_data(geonames_id)

    Geomash::Geonames.get_tgn_data(tgn_id)

The are also several functions in the Geomash::Standardizer that may be useful. For instance, there is a geographic list
dedupper. So, if you have ['Saigon, Vietnam', 'Saigon (Vietnam)'], it can reduce that down to just ['Saigon, Vietnam'].
In addition, passing "true" as the second variable will eliminate less specific cases, or an array of
['Saigon, Vietnam', 'Saigon (Vietnam)', 'Vietnam'] would return the same end result.

Within Geomash::TownLookup, there is a town listing for Massachusetts that one can use by the following:

    Geomash::TownLookup.state_town_lookup('MA', <string to parse>)

Feel free to add your own location to this as a potential shortcut from hitting web APIs. Currently this only supports
TGN and needs to be refactored to support other needs.
